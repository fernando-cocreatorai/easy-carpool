groupcarpool
caroster (need to test more, no clear flow)
mywaytogo (big website, not ideal for mobile, too many options at once, doesn't show all carpool options if there's no match, users Passenger and rider interchangeabily instead of sticking to one, map toggle covers button to edit commute, button to edit commute is also for editing one time trip, too many pool options for our use case, buttons used as tabs and as section collapser)

all others are paid
